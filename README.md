<h1>Rook 2020 Scalable</h1>

<p>This is my mod for the Rook 2020 to make it fully scalable to any size.<br />
<br />
To determine your extrusion and rail lenghts, add 150mm to your bed-size and 100mm to your desired Z-height<br />
<br />
so for a 200x200x200 build volume, your extrusions would be 350x350 for top and bottom frame and 300 for Z.<br />
<br />
X-axis extrusion and rail is 50mm shorter than your top frame.<br />
<br />
Supports MGN9C for the Z axis and X axis, and MGN12C for Y-axis.<br />
In theory, the X axis can use any rail to adapt to your desired printhead.</p>
