<h1> Rook 2020 Scalable</h1>

<p>This is my mod for the Rook 2020 to make it fully scalable to any size.<br />

<p>This also adds a tripple belted Z-axis<br />
<br />
Uses the same BOM as the ROOK 2020, but with some additional hardware.<br />
<em>(Full BOM will be made when it is built and tested)</em></p>

<p><br />
<em><strong>To determine your extrusion and rail lenghts, add 150mm to your bed-size and 100mm to your desired Z-height</strong></em><br />
<br />
For a 200x200x200 build volume, your extrusions would be 350x350 for top and bottom frame and 300 for Z.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>X-axis extrusion and rail is 50mm shorter than your top frame.</strong></em><br />
<br />
Supports MGN9C for the Z axis and X axis, and MGN12C for Y-axis.<br />
In theory, the X axis can use any rail to adapt to your desired printhead.<br />
Here is a calculator by MartinBspheroid to help you find your sizes!<br />
